Original Text: "I want to have a list of menu items with ingredients, allergen information, prices listed on the sides. There may be categories of foods. A warning should be about raw meat consumption at the bottom of the page. As the owner, I will be the only one adding/removing menu items. The hosts and other staff can only set other information about the items. The menu will display our company name and logo at the top. There should also be a tagline somewhere around the logo/company name that I can change time to time. Like a greeting text maybe. The first one might be something like this: 'Welcome to Flavortown!'. I don't know whether it should be animated or written in shiny text. Show me something about it so that I can decide."
