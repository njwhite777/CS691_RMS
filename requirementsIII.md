Original Text: "I want to have a list of menu items with ingredients, allergen information, prices listed on the sides. There may be categories of foods. A warning should be about raw meat consumption at the bottom of the page. As the owner, I will be the only one adding/removing menu items. The hosts and other staff can only set other information about the items. The menu will display our company name and logo at the top. There should also be a tagline somewhere around the logo/company name that I can change time to time. Like a greeting text maybe. The first one might be something like this: 'Welcome to Flavortown!'. I don't know whether it should be animated or written in shiny text. Show me something about it so that I can decide."

Iteration II: "I own 3 different restaurants in town. I want to use this software in my other restaurants too. Keep this in mind. I also want my customers to be able to give orders, like they can select a few of the menu items in a cart-like structure and then, they can give orders. Orders should be seen by the director so that he can assign a waiter to that order for preparation. And weekly, I want to see a report of all orders and the workload on the waiters."

Iteration III: "Each order should have some kind of status. Some may be received, others may be in-preparation, final touches, on the way etc. The customer can see this but only director can change the status of an order. I also want customers to add some tip while giving the orders."
